# Hybrid Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection System

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to detect malicious network traffic and anomalies.

The system combines supervised and unsupervised learning models to improve detection performance on large-scale network datasets.

---

## 🚀 Objectives
- Detect anomalous and malicious network activity
- Reduce false positives using hybrid modeling
- Compare supervised and unsupervised techniques
- Provide scalable and efficient detection

---

## 🧠 Models Used
1. Autoencoder (Deep Learning-based anomaly detection)
2. Isolation Forest (Unsupervised anomaly detection)
3. Random Forest (Supervised classification)

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib

## ⚙ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the project:
   python main.py

---

## 📂 Dataset
The model was trained on a large-scale network intrusion dataset (200,000+ records).
Due to GitHub size limitations, the full dataset is not included.
